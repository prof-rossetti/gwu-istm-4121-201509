# Group Project

## Description

Students will work together in instructor-assigned teams of two, three, or four
 to design and implement a relational database-backed information system
 which fulfills the project requirements.

### Component Assignments

The [Midterm Pitch](assignments/group-project/midterm-pitch.md) evaluates student ability to
 analyze business problems,
 identify a technology solution
 and communicate design plans.

The [Final Documentation](assignments/group-project/final-documentation.md) deliverable evaluates student ability to
 produce a physical, conceptual, and logical database system design,
 and to communicate instructions for using the system.

The [Final Implementation ](assignments/group-project/final-implementation.md) deliverable evaluates student ability to
 implement a functional database system.

The [Final Presentation](assignments/group-project/final-presentation.md) evaluates student ability to
 communicate system design and demonstrate system implementation functionality.

## Submission Instructions

Refer to the submission instructions for each component assignment.

Each group should elect a representative who will be responsible for communicating progress and submitting assignments on behalf of all group members.

## Evaluation Methodology

Refer to the evaluation methodologies for each component assignment.

Each member of the group will receive the same grade for each group project assignment submission.

At the end of the semester, a group member evaluation form will give each student an opportunity to identify the relative contributions of each other group member. The result of these evaluations may influence individual grades on group project assignments.
