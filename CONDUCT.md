# University Codes of Conduct

## Academic Integrity

Although students are encouraged to work with each other to discuss and solve problems, submission of identical or nearly identical work will be seen as an infraction of the honor code and could lead to failure or dismissal. See the Honor Code policy for more information.

## Honor Code

Students are to adhere to the Code of Student Conduct, and other policies and regulations as adopted and promulgated by appropriate University authorities. Copies of these documents may be obtained from the Office of the Dean of Students or from the offices of the academic deans.  No infractions will be tolerated.  Students violating the Code of Student Conduct will be dismissed from class and will receive an “F” for the course.

## Religious Holidays

The university policy regarding religious holidays is that it is the student’s responsibility to notify faculty during the first week of the semester of their intention to be absent from class on their days(s) of religious observance. The faculty continues to extend to these students the courtesy of absence without penalty on such occasions, including permission to make up examinations.

## Disabilities

Any student who needs an accommodation based on the impact of a disability should contact the Office of Disability Support Services (Marvin Center 242) at 202-994-8250.  The DSS will contact the professor. You must inform both your lab and lecture professor about any accommodations that DSS recommends.
